# Scripts for reading UD corpora

* `corpusIterator.py` provides utilities for reading raw UD treebanks.

* `corpusIterator_FuncHead.py` is a wrapper carrying out the changes described in Materials and Methods promoting certain dependents to be heads, following Futrell et al. 2015.


Obtaining the corpora:

* Download the UD 2.1 dump from https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2515.

* Obtain copyrighted parts of French (`UD_French-FTB`) and Arabic (`Arabic-NYUAD`) treebanks. The copyrighted parts affect only the annotation with individual words, they are not needed for the unlexicalized parser.
